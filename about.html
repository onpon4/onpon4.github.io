        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My name is Julie Marchant. You may know me as "onpon4", which was the username I exclusively used for several years. More recently, I have taken to primarily using "Julie.chan" or "The Diligent Circle".</p>
        <p>I am reasonably well-known in the libre software community as a libre game developer. I developed and maintain the SGE Game Engine, and I have also developed several libre games, most of which use said engine. Languages I currently know well are Python, C, and Lua; Python is the language I prefer for the most part.</p>
        <p>In addition to programming, I have an affinity for the Japanese language. My Japanese proficiency is very poor, especially considering how long I have been studying it on and off, but I can hold a very basic conversation okay. Gaining fluency in Japanese is one of my major goals.</p>
        <p>My day job is nothing too glamorous: I'm just a humble cashier. I actually love cashiering, though, so I am quite happy with this situation and I take great pride in my work.</p>
        <p>Less professionally:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you guessed that my favorite color is purple, you guessed correctly.</li>
            <li>I love jewelry, and I sometimes make my own bracelets as a hobby.</li>
            <li>I love spiders. They're adorable, and they eat pests. Don't hurt innocent spiders! &gt;:(</li>
            <li>I also love cats, despite being mildly allergic to them (nothing serious, they just make my eyes and nose itch).</li>
            <li>Spicy food is my life. I <em>love</em> spicy food. I usually use a ghost pepper sauce to make things spicy, and I get extra-hot at Thai places.</li>
            <li>Thai food is my favorite kind of food. Other international foods I like a lot are Mexican and Chinese (of course).</li>
            <li>As far as American foods go, Buffalo wings are easily my favorite. I make my Buffalo wings by frying them, unbreaded, in coconut oil, then covering them with the Buffalo wing sauce. It's delicious and healthy at the same time!</li>
        </ul>

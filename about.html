        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>We're The Diligent Circle, a plural system with two known members: Layla (the host, she/her; signs with üï∑Ô∏è) and Emmy (they/them; signs with üïµÔ∏è). You may know us as "onpon4", which was the username we exclusively used for several years (mainly prior to our transition). More recently, we have taken to primarily using "The Diligent Circle", although the old username still exists on some sites.</p>
        <p>We are transgender, pansexual, non-monogamous, and neurodivergent. For what it's worth, we're very proud of what we are, and some of Layla's favorite bracelets to wear are LGBTQ+ pride bracelets.</p>
        <p>On that note, Layla is into jewelry and actually makes necklaces and bracelets. She sells these on our <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/DiligentCircle">Etsy shop</a>.</p>
        <p>We are also a video game, card game, and board game developer/designer. Programming languages we currently know well are Python, C, and Lua. You can support all of these (and other artistic endeavors) through our <a href="https://liberapay.com/diligentcircle/">Liberapay</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/diligentcircle">Patreon</a> pages.</p>
        <p>We have an affinity for the Japanese language, especially Emmy. Our Japanese proficiency is not that great, especially considering how long we have been studying it on and off, but we can hold a very basic conversation okay.</p>

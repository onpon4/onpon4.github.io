        <h2>Libre Game Recommendations</h2>
        <p>It can sometimes be hard to tell which of the hundreds of libre games out there are really worth trying. I would like to help out with that. To that end, I have compiled a list of libre games that I think are worth playing in their own right, regardless of whether or not you're a libre software movement proponent. So basically, whoever you are and whatever your politics are, give these games a try! :) The games are listed alphabetically, ignoring any leading articles ("the" or "a"). Links are provided to the most relevant and useful pages available for each of the games. Note that if you are using a GNU/Linux distro, the best way to install any of these is through the package manager, if possible.</p>
        <p>Please note that this list does not include games that are clearly designed to be very similar to other, more popular games, unless they do a good job distinguishing themselves either with noticeably better production value or with substantial design changes. In short: no clones. This list also does not include any game which is in an incomplete (alpha) state. A list of all rejected games is found in my <a href="rejected-libre-games.html">Rejected Libre Games</a> list.</p>
        <p>Please feel free to <a href="../contact.html">contact me</a> if you know of any additional libre games that should be listed here.</p>

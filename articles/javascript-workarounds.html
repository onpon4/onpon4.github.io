        <h2>Workarounds for JavaScript Requirements</h2>
        <p>This article is a supplement to my other article, "<a href="kill-js.html">Why (and How) to Kill JavaScript</a>".</p>
        <p>Despite what many people think, most websites work perfectly fine, or often even better, without JavaScript. However, this is not universal; some websites, including popular ones, are not designed to work without JavaScript. Such websites often fail to allow users to interact with them fully without JavaScript, and sometimes won't even show users anything without JavaScript. So this article explains easy ways to work around various JavaScript requirements.</p>
        <p>If you know of any workarounds I haven't documented here, please <a href="mailto:onpon4@riseup.net">contact me</a> so I can add it.</p>
        <p>If a website you must use requires JavaScript and is not on this list, I would recommend using NoScript. Be sure to remove <em>all</em> of the default whitelist entries, as there are a lot of them. You can then either whitelist the websites you need to use, or you can simply enable JavaScript for a single tab. I prefer the latter solution, but use whatever method works for you to keep as much JavaScript junk out of your face as possible.</p>
        <aside><p>On a side note, please thank website maintainers when their websites work without JavaScript. The more people express appreciation for JavaScript-free support, the more website maintainers will continue to provide that support. Thanking website maintainers for good JavaScript-free support is possibly the best way people who are not website maintainers can encourage those who are to move toward a JavaScript-free ecosystem.</p></aside>

            <summary>Email</summary>
            <p>While webmail used to work the right way (without JavaScript) most places, in recent years, many email hosts have opted for interfaces that require JavaScript. Additionally, many popular email hosts now require JavaScript to sign up.</p>
            <p>One easy solution for the former problem is to use an email client, such as Thunderbird. This may be an incomplete solution depending on your email host, but it should suffice most of the time.</p>
            <p>A perfect solution would be to switch to an email provider with no JavaScript requirements anywhere. Some do exist, but they're few and far between. Here is a list of the ones I know about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://riseup.net">Riseup.net</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you know of any others that work completely without JavaScript, please <a href="mailto:onpon4@riseup.net">contact me</a> and let me know.</p>
            <p>Another full solution is to self-host your email. This is technically more challenging that using an email host, but if you can do it, it's the ideal choice.</p>

            <summary>Video sharing (YouTube)</summary>
            <p>The official YouTube website does not work at all without JavaScript, but there are many unofficial workarounds. By far the most simple workaround is <a href="https://www.invidio.us">Invidious</a>, which is a YouTube frontend that works entirely without JavaScript, among other advantages.</p>
            <p>The author and host of Invidious has expressed interest in adding support for uploading videos at some point, but in the meantime, a public <a href="https://wiki.mediagoblin.org/Live_instances">MediaGoblin instance</a> will do the trick for sharing videos. Alternatively, you can host your own MediaGoblin instance.</p>
            <p>It's also worth noting that most popular video hosts work with youtube-dl, a tool for downloading videos. This is a fairly reasonable workaround for video hosts other than YouTube, such as Dailymotion and Vimeo.</p>
